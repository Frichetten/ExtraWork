# ExtraWork
Consolidated random repos to form this one. Place where I put all extra or random coding work.

Over time I found that I had created a lot of random repositories to hold small projects, test code, or things that were fun. It inflated the number of repositories under my account, and as a result, made it more difficult to see what projects I have worked on during my free time. To fix this, I have moved all of that random code to this single repository, and deleted the original. Here you will find all of my random work, and a list has been provided below.

**Ace Finder - Python**  
**HTMLParsing - Python**  
**Random Haskell Repo - Haskell**  
**Client To Server Communication Repo - Python**
